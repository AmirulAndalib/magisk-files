## FAQ

### How to switch from current Magisk to Magisk Delta and vice versa?

> Some Mediatek devices prevent boot partition from being modified (or kernel doesn't allow to modify boot image) after booting. When directly installing, you might end up with "/dev/xxxx is read-only" error or the installation seems to be successful but actually fails. In this case, please try patching boot image with Magisk app and flash it from Custom Recovery or Fastboot instead. 

The fast way to migrate to Magisk Delta or switch back to official Magisk: Just flash magisk app like a module.

1. Rename the extension `magisk.apk` to `magisk.zip`
2. Open Magisk app, click "Modules" tab -> "Install from storage" and choose `magisk.zip`
3. Reboot your device


### How to install Magisk into emulator (such as NoxPlayer, LDPlayer, etc...)?

> Currently, only Magisk Delta support Magisk installation into system partition. Although emulator has ramdisk image, patching ramdisk is not used because ramdisk is stored in seperate partition with very SMALL disk size that is not enough to store Magisk binaries.

1. Enable Root access in emulator settings
2. Install and open Magisk Delta
3. Grant root access to Magisk Delta, click "Install" under Magisk field and use "Direct Install into system partition" option instead of "Direct Install" option. If you don't see this option, close and re-open Magisk Delta app.
4. Disable Root access in emulator settings

### Why restore MagiskHide?

MagiskHide is still effectively useful to hide root from almost banking apps and games after it was discontinued by the original developer. 

The reasons why I restore MagiskHide:
- MagiskHide is removed from official Magisk
- [Zygisk is easily detected](#zygisk-is-easily-detected) and there are nearly no complete hiding method for Zygisk.
- The new feature of Magisk called Zygisk is incompatible with Riru

### Why not restore Magisk modules online repo?

The official Magisk modules repository is dead and no longer maintained. Due to that, add them back is meanless. However, [Fox2Code](https://github.com/Fox2Code) has developed [Magisk Modules Manager](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxMagiskModuleManager)  app which allows you to download Magisk modules online.
